# TTS_model_comparison
M.Sc. in Language Technology - Speech Synthesis Technologies assignment

In this project we were asked to use and evaluate several TTS models using  coquiTTS, an open-source speech synthesis tool developed by the Coqui AI team using Python text to speech.
This repo contains scripts for generating synthetic speech with TTS models and vocoders of your choice.
